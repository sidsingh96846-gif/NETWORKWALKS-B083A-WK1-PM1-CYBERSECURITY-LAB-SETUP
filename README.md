NETWORKWALKS-B083A-WK1-PM1-CYBERSECURITY-LAB-SETUP
Cybersecurity Lab Environmental Setup
Building an Isolated virtual lab built with VirtualBox and Kali Linux machine for Cyberscurity testing and penetration testing.

Project Overview
This project focuses on setting up a virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory using VirtualBox and Kali Linux. The aim of the lab is to create a sandbox environment where cybersecurity tools, network scanning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and other security activities can be performed safely and frequently. The lab is configured on a private virtual network to allow additional machines to be added later on and also used as targets for authorized security testing

Objectives
The major aim of this project is to;

Install and configure VirtueBox
Install and Kali Linux as a virtual machine
Select a private NAT Network for the cybersecurity lab
Configure network and ensure connectivity for Kali Linux
Assign a static IP address to the Kali VM.
Verify network connecting and DNS resolution
Take a snapshot of the VM for easy data recovery
Document the entire setup process
Prepare the environment for future cybersecurity projects
Purpose of the lab
The lab supported an isolated and controlled environment for cybersecurity learning and authorized security testing. Also, it can be used for activities like;

Network reconnaissance
Port scanning
Vulnerability assessment
Packet analysis
Web security testing
Exploitation practice
Security-tool experimentation
⚠️ It is important to note that this laboratory must only be used for systems that you own and have proper permission to test. Ensure not to use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems.

⚙️ Lab Configuration
🧩 Component	⚙️ Configuration
💻 Host OS	Windows 11
🧠 Host Ram	16 GB
⚡Processor	Intel Core i7
🧰 Hypervisor	VirtualBox 7.2
🐉 Security OS	Kali Linux 2026.2
🧠 Kali RAM	2048 MB
🌎 Virtual Network	NAT Network
📡 Network Address	10.0.0.0/24
🦤 Kali IP Address	10.0.0.2/24
🚪 Default Gateway	10.0.0.1
🌎 DNS Server	8.8.8.8
Lab Setup Procedure
Step 1. Install 7-Zip
In order to extract the Kali Linux virtual machine package, 7-zip was installed to extract it, because the package downloaded as a .7z archive. Tool: 7-Zip

Step 2. Install Virtual Box
VirtualBox was installed as the Hypervisor

Step 3. Create the NAT Network
A NAT Network was created in the VirtualBox Configuration: Network Name: NatNetwork IPv4 Prefix: 10.0.0.0/24 DHCP: Enabled IPv6: Enabled NAT Network settings A NAT Network was selected because it allows more than one virtual machines connected on the same NAT Network to communicate with each other while also having outbound network connection.

This network makes room for future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.

Step 4. Import Kali Linux
Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and it was imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
A static IP address makes it easier to document the lab and make reference to Kali machine in future exercises.

Editing wired connections

Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot
After the successful configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created. The snapshot name:

New Kali Network Setup
This snapshot represents the clean baseline of the lab.

In case of any future exercise alters the VM configuration, the machine can be restored back to this baseline.

Lab Verification
Test	Command	Expected Result
🌎 Check IP Address	ip a	Correct Kali IP address displayed
📡 Test Gateway	ping 10.0.0.1	Successful replies
🌎 Test Internet Connectivity	ping 8.8.8.8	Successful replies
🔎 Test DNS resolution	nslookup networkwalks.com	Domain resolves
🧰 Verify Nmap	nmap --version	Nmap version displayed
🔄 Verify snapshot	Restore snapshot and run ip a	Baseline configuration restored
Example Results
IP Address:
10.0.0.2/24

Gateway ;
10.0.0.1

DNS:
8.8.8.8
What I Learned
During the course of this project, I learned how to create and configure a virtual environment for cybersecurity practice. The main concepts I learned were:

1. NAT vs NAT Network
A NAT configuration and a NAT Network have different purposes NAT configuration allows internet access but does not give access to machines on the VM to communicate with each other. NAT Network allows more than 1 machines to communicate with each other, it also allows internet access. This makes it an integral part of building a multi-machine cybersecurity laboratory.

2. Virtual Machine Networking
I learned how VirtualBox virtual network adapters connect virtual machines to different types of networks and also how a network configuration affects how machines communicate with each other.

3. Static IP Configuration
I learned how to configure and verify a static IPv4, subnet masks, gateways and DNS settings in Kali Linux.

4. VM Snapshots
I learned that it is important to create a clean snapshot should be created before performing risky activities. This makes recovery easy for future tasks.

5. Documentation
I learned that documenting commands, configuration, screenshots, problems and solution is a very important part of professional cybersecurity project.

Security & Ethical Use
This laboratory is only for education purposes only.
